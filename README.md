# Excel Neural Network

Excel is everyone's favorite spreadsheets app. From running Doom to 3D physics engines, Excel can do it all. For [Hack&Roll 2024](https://hacknroll.nushackers.org/), we will be implementing a neural network completely within Excel.

### Strategy

We will be implementing a Python script that converts preprocessed `.csv` files into a neural network. All calculations will be performed within Excel using VBA.
